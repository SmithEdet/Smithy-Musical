          was established in 1989 to offer basic music training for children and
          adults interested in learning how to sing or play any musical
          instrument. In 2002 the School received the Nigerian Federal
          Government’s accreditation to award Diplomas in Music which can be
          equated with those awarded by the Associated Board of the Royal
          Schools of Music in the United Kingdom.. The Society is the proud
          owner of Nigeria’s only professional Symphony Orchestra and a renowned
          Choir, both of which now constitute unique platforms for training and
          grooming promising young Nigerian artistes and instrumentalists in the
          performance of classical and orchestral music at the highest level.

              their new work environment.

              It has been a real pleasure for me to have a company like Maramin
              Engineering limited to build our Founders Hall. Your staff not
              only delivered a beautiful facility for our residents within the
              time allotted but also helped us value engineer this facility to
              help keep the cost within budget. This was done without
              sacrificing quality.
